# Disclaimer

All stats are without warranty.
They are taken from:

curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "find", "params": { "contract": "market", "table": "tradesHistory", "query": { "symbol": "ALIVE"}, "limit":1000, "offset": 0 }, "id": 1 }' 'https://herpc.kanibot.com/contracts'

I have put them into logfiles and uploaded them to Kibana, from which I took the screenshots.
If you find errors, please tell me!

If you want me to continue the stats, give me some good upvotes ;-)

If you want to see other statistics (even from totaly other data), please contact me. I can create them weekly or monthly if I get some rewards for it.

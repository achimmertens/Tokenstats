## $POB Summarize Metrics

This table shows how much $HIVE was given by buy-requests, that where equal or higher than the sell order vs. sell-requests, that were equal or lower than the buy order.
If the buy-requests where higher than the sell-requests, then money comes into the system and the value of the token increases.

Under the total line one can see the sum of $HIVE and sum of $POB that changed the ownership and the average price of $POB for the last period.

The average price of the token in the picture is wrong, actually it was: xxx $HIVE/$POB

# Some Rules for the BEER Token

![](https://images.hive.blog/0x0/https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/detlev/Lw1P9Iw8-image.png)
The BEER token is a "Thank You!" to other Hive community members. So please use it as this.
It is not a coin to make yourself rich.
People that always circle the beer commands in daily usage get blacklisted.
Please follow the @beerlover blog to get more details.

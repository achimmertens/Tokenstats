# Some More Words
Last week one person, wanderingmoon, asked me for beeing put into my blacklist. He doesn't get bothered any more by my reports. 
So if you also don't want to be tagged any more, just give me a reply "please don't tag me anymore".
The the "@" will be removed from your name.
Btw. I added this feature in 1,5 hour developing (from understanding until last, commit including tests) , with the help of ai. This was the fastest feature I have implemented so far ;-)

I wish you a nice week,



Achim Mertens

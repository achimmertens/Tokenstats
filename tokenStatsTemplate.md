# Some More Words
I have worked on my tokenstats code last week. I have added the beerbot statistics. They are automated now also. And they are back. I have left them out in the last weeks, because they are manual work and I didn't had the time to do it. But for the future, they should appear regularly.
I have worked on the timeframe automation. Until now, it was static to 7 days. But when I leave one week out in my statistics, I want to have a 14 days statistics afterwards. This ment to me, that I had to do some manual work in the code. Now I have one place, where I just type in the number of days, for which I want to do the statistics.

I wish you a nice week,



Achim Mertens

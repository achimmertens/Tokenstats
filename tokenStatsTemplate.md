# My last Week 
Last week was totally different from the previous weeks. In our company we have a lot of movements. My job position is in danger and we shall reduce our team. So we had a lot of emotional discussions. 
So that week I didn't work a lot for Hive as my head was somewhere else, but not here. 
I hope we get more clearness and therefore better planings for the future in the next days.


Regards,

Achim Mertens

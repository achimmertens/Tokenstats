# My last Week 
This week my focus was on creating a task for Hive users. You can see it here: https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@achimmertens/ich-biete-einen-taski-offer-a-task-expense-60-minutes-reward-30-hive-topic-curation
There I offer a task, where one can earn 30 Hive for a about 60 Minute work.
It is a test balloon. If this works, I want to invest more time into a Hive-Job-Exchange. So this offer has a special format. It can be used for further task offers or searches. If it grows bigger, we can create like "linkedIn" with Hive.
I also created a new advertising campaing. This time for myself, as I want my task offer to be seen by more people: https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/hive-marketing-campaign-24012601-week-4-for-achimmertens

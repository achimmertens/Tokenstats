# Some More Words
## New Account "advertisingbot2"
I have switched the account for the reports. I have created the account "@advertisingbot2" and I use it to distribute the reports (accept for the Alive group, there you find it under my old name).
This is because of spamminator. He and I don't have the same opinion about getting rewarded. I think, that when you do some work, which other people appreciate, you should get payed for it. Even if it is automated. (Btw. I don't spend it for myself, but forward it to @anobel and donate it there.)

But he thinks, that if you create content, that looks very similar to what you have posted before, it is spam.
I could not explain to him, that the real content is in the figures and in the tables, so we don't come together.

So this is my solution. I think, advertisingbot2 will get punished for it. But we will see. I need this motivation to go on.
It's not the best solution, but better than burning all earned Hive.

## Some Data Is Missing
I don't know why. All my systems to collect the data where up and running and I didn't touch them during 19.10. and 21.10.23. But in this timeframe I didn't get any data.


Regards,

Achim Mertens

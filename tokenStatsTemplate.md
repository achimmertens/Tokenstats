# Data is complete now
The Data problem from the week before last week is definitely solved now. After changing the API server I have had no outages any more.

# My Week On Hive
This week I have had two main topics: Working on my advertisingbot automation and creating a ChatGPT Assistant. In both I made good progress.
The advertisingbot has got some small features, which help me to do less manual work. To see what he is doing, follow @advertisingbot2.
And with the GPT Assistant I made a breakthrough: I have created an assistant on Openai, I can chat with it and I have put some lokal data into it. The result is fascinating: https://peakd.com/hive-139531/@achimmertens/mein-erster-gpt-assistent (It is in German language. If you want to read it in English, click on AI/translation.)

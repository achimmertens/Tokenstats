# My last Week 
For me the new years starts great. Private everithng is fine and so I can go on with my hobby: "Make Hive great" ;-)
I managed to create my first Javascript, that pays automatecally Hive Users. So I made some rules to pay them only once to get not poor during the testphase ;-)
This is my first smart contract!!!
I have created a json file with recipients (which come from the advertising contests, details see @advertisingbot2) and now I can just type in a command, and the winners of the contest get payed automatecally.
Now I have 90% of the automation done and can go on with bug fixing and promotion of my advertising project.

Regards,

Achim Mertens

# Some More Words
Last week I have enhanced my Javascript Code to create these reports. Now I am able to send my reports automatecally. This doens't mean that there is no hand on. I still have to collect the data and check them afterwards, if they are valid. 
I compare my automatecally created reports with the content, that I see in my Kibana database. This still is manually work that remains.

As promised last week, let's come to my vote:
I have tagged your names in my tables. Some people find it good to be tagged, that they have reached the top twenty. Others are annoyed.
I have both opinions and I want to see what is the majority.
So, please give me an answer:
"Yes, keep on tagging the names"
or
"No, please stop tagging names"

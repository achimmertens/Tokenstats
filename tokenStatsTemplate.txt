Weekly Statistics For The [TOKEN] Token

Hello,

I had some trouble with @spaminator.
For me it is very important to continue giving this service to you in the future, but I don't want to get downvoted everywhere I make a post or give a comment.
So I talked with @spaminator alias Hivewatch in discord. I had this problem few month ago and there I thought it would be engough to donate the Hive-rewards to Hive-fund for my beerbot-report.
And yes, it worked for some weeks, but now he is back.
First I was very angry, because I think, that I don't fraud the system. All the money I earn with my reports is send to @anobel, who distributes it among some people in need or do good things.
But then he wrote, that at least 50% of my text should be new and not static. After some thinking I came to the conclusion, that this is a good compromise. On the one hand I reduce some repeating, static text, so I reduce the need of recources.
On the other hand I can go on with my reports.
So for the future the reports are thinner and I hope, that this will end my downvotes.
Maybe you can give me some further hints and thoughts about this topic in the comments.

So, here are the:

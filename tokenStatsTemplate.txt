Weekly Statistics For The [TOKEN] Token

Hello dear Hivers,

I found a solution for the struggle with @spaminator.
You may remember, that he accused me of spamming and plagiarism with my reports.
I described it in detail [here](https://peakd.com/hive/@achimmertens/the-end-of-my-money-printing-machine).
Conclusion:
- I will continue creating token reports.
- For the ALIVE-Token I will take the rewards from the upvotes and give them to @anobel who donates them to needy people.
- For all [other tokens](https://peakd.com/@achimmertens?filter=stats) I will donate them to Hive-Fund.

The last point is a compromise, and I am still not really happy with that. Yes, I have automated my work to 80%, but it is still some work. And why shouldn't I get some rewards for my self-scripted programs?
At least some people want to see my reports.

What do you think? Is creating (automated) reports plagiarism?
Or do you think my reports are spam and should be stopped? (I am not talking about tagging. This is another topic that I want to discuss with you later.)

Please leave a comment to give me a feeling of what you think about it.


So, here are the:
